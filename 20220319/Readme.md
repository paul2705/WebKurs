## 应用层协议设计及落地

*   The protocol has been SAVED in the folder `MALPJS`
    * I've created a Server which will set an integer in $[0,10]$ waiting for Client to guess. 
    * I've created a Client to guess the integer previously set on the Server.
    * The Client will first send a hello message to the Server.
*   The folder is the abbreviation for `My Application Layer Protocol JS`
*   The other folder `MALPK-Waste` is a exercise that I tried to use `C++` to create a parser of Protocol, but it haven't been completed.
